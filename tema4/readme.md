1. For a moderate-sized prime p (e.g., p is on 32 bits), generate α, a primitive root modulo p and then compute logarithm modulo p to the base α of β, for an arbitrary β, using <b><i>Shanks</i></b> or Pollard algorithm.

2. Implement the Silver-Pohlig-Hellman algorithm for computing discrete logarithms modulo a large prime p (e.g., p is on 1024 bits). Assume that p - 1 has only small prime divisors and that its prime factorization is known in advance.
